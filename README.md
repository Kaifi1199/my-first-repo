This Lab 9 of GitHub.

GitHub is a cloud-based platform that allows users to: 
Store, share, and collaborate on code: Users can create a "repository" to store their code, and then share it with others. Team members can access the repository to view the most recent version of the code in real-time, and make edits that are visible to everyone. 
Track changes: GitHub allows users to track and manage changes to their code over time. 
Use GitHub Apps: GitHub Apps are tools that can extend GitHub's functionality. For example, a GitHub App can open issues, comment on pull requests, or manage projects. 



GitHub uses Git software, which provides:
Distributed version control
Access control
Bug tracking
Software feature requests
Task management
Continuous integration
Wikis for every project
